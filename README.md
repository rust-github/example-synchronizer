# example-synchronizer

This project used to keep the [example](https://github.com/rust-github/rust-gh-example) up to date with the [template](https://github.com/rust-github/template).

This repository is now archived because the syncronization is done in the CI of the [template](https://github.com/rust-github/template) itself.
